# GetCleanData

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project:

The .R file in this repo requires the plyr package to run. After installing with install.packages in R, load with library("plyr"). This is due to ddply which is used later in the script. An error will be produced if you do not have it.

Project goal was to practice cleaning data. This involved tasks such as combining datasets and re-labeling columns for interpretation by others who may not be familiar with the data and its previous naming conventions. A final document, tidyset.txt was produced and is included in the repo.

Data:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones was the data used for this project (source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones )
